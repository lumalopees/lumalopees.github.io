To challenge myself and work on the lessons learned, I will create a challenge for each phase of the course. The first module, Fundamentals of Web Development, is over and now I will deliver the first mirrored challenge.

Chores:

- Challenge One: HTML and CSS, create a landpage!

- Challenge Two: JAVASCRIPT, help a neighborhood gym to modernize, creating functions that speed up its operation.

- Challenge Three: JAVASCRIPT, create a fun little color guessing game with logic and your soul.

- Challenge Four: FORMS, classes at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are ending and, in modern 2023, a quick satisfaction survey is taking place.

- Challenge Five: HIGHFUNCTIONS and TESTS, solves a small and friendly list of logic problems, developing functions and/or their respective tests.

- Challenge Six: JAVASCRIPT, your work at the neighborhood gym gave you the opportunity to develop the software for a popular pet beauty salon chain, do your best!
